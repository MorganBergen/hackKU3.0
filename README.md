# hackKU3.0
Hackathon Project for HackKU 2022

## Clarity

### Inspiration
Our ultimate vision is to create a platform where users can look up a company's name and click a button to generate visual representation of the data that's accessible to anyone.
We are passionate about the environment and wanted to use our skills to make positive change through digital tools.

### What it does
Interactive website that serves as a template for receiving and displaying data.
Buttons link to other pages and external links

### How we built it
Mapped out a list of what we wanted for our prototype based on what was attainable in 36 hours
Divided up responsibilities between front-end and back-end sub-teams
Researched tools and decided to use Django, HTML, CSS, Python
Used GitHub as our central, shared repository
Worked together in the engineering complex to talk through ideas and collaborate to solve our issues.

### Challenges we ran into
Issues installing Django
Had to create multiple versions of the repository
Issues with merge conflicts since there were four of us
Communicating our expectations and ideas
Timeline planning

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
Appealing UI design
Effectively running the server
Creating a static site
Collaborating
Challenging ourselves with a big project but also adjusting our expectations along the way
Working from scratch as much as possible so we could better understand the inner-workings of our site

### What we learned
Fundamentals of web development
Working as a team on a large project and how to divide up the workload
Learned how to use GitHub, LiveServer extension for VS Code, integrate Django, HTML, Python, and CSS

### What's next for Clarity
We will have it interact with large volumes of data, have it automatically generate graphs on command for users.
Use real companies' data and market to real users
